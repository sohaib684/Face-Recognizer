# Face-Detector

A script designed to classify faces of "humans" using any of the following algorithms
- LBPH Model
- Eigen Face Model
- Fisher Model

Database of individual's face should be stored inside the folder `Database/[Person's Name]`. Test subject faces should be stored inside the folder `Testing`. 

\
Once everything is set, install the required dependencies using the command
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

\
Then, to run the script, execute `index.py`. Using the command
```
python index.py
```

\
You should get the list of person's name, from the images of individuals which are stored inside the Testing folder and the confidence level of the algorithm, in the output of index.py.

## Live Face Detection

In this feature, script connects to your webcam and tries to recognize all the faces visible by matching it with the ones in the database. It shows the candidate name and algorithm's confidence level, inside the video stream.

\
To use this feature, execute `live.py`. Using the command
```
python live.py
```

## Record Candidate's Sample Video

In order to make detector to work, it needs to be trained on the images of different candidates that are to be classified inside Database Folder. To collect these data simply execute `recorder.py`. Using the commad
```
python recorder.py
```

### Model should be trained each time, the database is updated.
Yes, each time you update the database folder, in order to see the effects you need to train `model.yml` with the new data. In order to do that, use the command
```
python train_model.py
```
